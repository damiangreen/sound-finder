sound-finder
============
The Idea is to show visually how musical artists relate to other artists
whether that is through genre, sales count etc
and to be able to display this network in differnet ways using information from disparate data sources; Amazon, Soundcloud etc
and possibly show a timeline of  how artists have originated over the years to show influence
The idea is to be a rich source of information to discover other music (and possibly link to) in an intuitive way
